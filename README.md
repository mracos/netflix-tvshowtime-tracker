Chrome extension to track netflix watched shows to tvshowtime

Actually I gave up doing this, but the scrapping from netflix is [done](src/content/netflix_content.js), sending the info to the extension script is *kinda* done, the part which connects to the tvshowtime API is not even started.

Well, thanks for all the fish.
